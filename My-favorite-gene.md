####The beginning of saxitoxin biosynthesis
---
sxtA is the gen that start the synthesis of the saxitoxin toxin in dinoflagellates, and there is the pathway of the biosynthesis

this gen is very important, because whitout this the dinoflagellate can not produce the saxitoxin

This gene are made for four domains, the dinoflagellate spliced-lider which is a typical to all dinoflagellates RNAm

Here leave the link to the paper where talk about the origin of the gene in dinoflagellates
